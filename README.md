### When the next MBTA train is due

**Published** Android App to give the next few commuter rail trains on the Boston MBTA.
The app is designed to have a **very** simple interface. You select a station from a complete
list of stations then the app gives you a screen with two tabs: Inbound/Outbound. The next time you use the app
your station selection is saved in a most recent list to make use faster and easier.
